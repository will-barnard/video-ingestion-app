# video-ingestion-app

Standalone Java app utilizing the JavaFX library that automates standard video ingestion workflows I encounter when editing recitals for online music schools

Application indexes and performs file I/O for video submissions, then writes data to a .csv

Submission data is dynamically loaded in after effects from the .csv
